Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is most simple type of regression method present.

## Working :
- We assume dependent and independent variables are both linearly related.
- We assume a line with which we will predict , but at first it is not good.
- So use **MSE(Mean Squared Error)** as loss function and use gradient descent to reduce the overall mse.
- To measure the performance of algorithm we use R2 statistics.
