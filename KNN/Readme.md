- K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
- K-NN uses Euclidean Distance for finding the similarity between the train data and the new given test data to perform classification.
- It is one of the most basic **Unsupervised Learning** algorithm.

## Euclidean Distance 
Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points. It can be calculated from the \
Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem.
